## Cost-effectively Automate FNOL Document Classification for Insurance Claims

## Overview

This Repository is consists of two approaches to automating document classification throughIntelligent Document Processing. These first approach is a traditional Machine Learning (ML) approach paired with generative AI for document classification. The second approach is a end to end pipeline leveraging generative AI. 

Each solution is broken down into CloudFormation templates and artifacts to deploy the respective solution along with the README for guidance:

## Core Features 

 * Intelligent Document Processing reducing manual categorization 
 * Fully Scalable to meet any customer demand
 * Easy modifiable to change categorization

## Target Market 

These solutions are designed for industries that rely heavily on manual document processing, which can be streamlined and automated. The target market for this offering includes businesses across various Insurance and banking sectors that struggle with inefficient paperwork management and classification. 

By digitizing hardcopy documents and automating the associated workflows, these solutions can deliver significant time and cost savings for the customer. The manual processes often result in delays and bottlenecks, as employees spend valuable resources on non-value-added tasks like classifying and sorting documentation. This not only adds resilience to the documentation processes, but also reduces the need for manual intervention in these time-consuming activities.

The key value proposition for the target market is the ability to transform manual, paper-based operations into efficient, digitized workflows. This can result in improved productivity, reduced administrative overhead, and better control over critical business documentation. The automation of document-centric processes allows the customer to reallocate resources towards more strategic initiatives, rather than getting bogged down in the classification and management of hardcopy documents.
